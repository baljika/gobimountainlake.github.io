Here, the dunes are ending themselves into the water, creating a surreal beach effect. This morning we meet our first Mongolian horses and local guides. For the next 4 days, you will likely ride the same horse every day, unless it’s not a good match or the horse needs a rest. Your guides will be pleased to assist you to adapt your riding style to suit the Mongolian horses and tack. You also discuss your saddles, stirrup lengths and other safety issues of horse riding before we begin our riding to the Great Sand Dune Lake. After 3 hours of wonderful riding through the gorgeous sand dune, valleys, up to the mountain, we will discover the great view of the surrounding area from the top of the southside mount of the lake. The view is amazing towards the endless sand dunes, mountains, lake, vast grasslands with many herds,  summer camps by nomads. A gourmet lakeside picnic will be set up for our lunch at the shore of the lake, facing lots of beautiful peninsulas and bays that penetrate into the lake water. We shall rest in the area for the afternoon, then ride back to the lodge.  In the evening, we will climb to the nearest hills.
